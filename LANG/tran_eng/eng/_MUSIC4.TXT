No.1   << ‰öãY’k ` Mystic Square >>  
The usual title theme. This is        
the song that really determined       
the direction of the rest of the      
game's music. Not bad, huh? (^^;

No.2        << Dream Express >>       
             Stage 1 theme            
This is a fairly rhythmical song.     
This song was made with the express   
intent of using it in a Touhou game,  
for once. (^^;                        
I hope you'll enjoy the rushing       
feeling of the Dream Express during   
the main part.

             Sara's theme             
This song really cements the image    
of the soundtrack of the game as a    
whole. It's kind of cool and has a    
kind of cute atmosphere about it.     
(I hope (^^;) It kind of feels like   
the color of Gensokyo comes through   
in the melody...

             Stage 2 theme            
I wanted it to have a catchy rhythm...
Listening to it, I guess the melody   
is cool, too. Well, the stage 1 song  
had a nice rhythm, right? So I wanted 
the stage 2 song to match the stage   
and have a sense of speed, and this is
how it turned out.

No.5  << —ì“V  ` Spiritual Heaven >> 
             Louise's theme           
This is the theme song for            
the boss whose reason for             
being here is unknown. (^^;           
This is too cool. (lol)               
Maybe I could have done a lot         
more with it...

No.6      << Romantic Children >>     
             Stage 3 theme            
It has a pretty good Makai feel       
about it, doesn't it?                 
The stage 1, 2, and 3 songs all       
turned out with a real sense of       
speed.                                
Since it's Makai, I think it feels    
more Western... yeah.

             Alice's theme            
If you listen earnestly (?), it's     
pretty dark. (^^; I think the third   
stage boss of a STG is a significant  
turning point, so I put some extra    
spirit into the making of this song.  
Well, it's not like I was slacking on 
the other songs or anything... (^^;

             Stage 4 theme            
This song really settles down suddenly
compared to the others. (You think?)  
This was a pretty hard song to make.  
Still, it came out pretty cool,       
I think.

          Yuki & Mai's theme          
I was going for something simple,     
yet cool in this song.                
This song is closest to the songs     
from the last game. It was really     
easy to finish compared to            
"Maple Wise". (^^;

No.10 <<^g‚Ì­— ` Crimson Dead!!>>
             Yuki's theme             
The melody is somehow similar to      
something from the Story of           
Eastern Wonderland. All I can         
really remember is before I           
knew it, the song was done.           
It's kind of like something           
from my older games.

             Mai's theme              
Compared to "Crimson Maiden", this    
one is a bit more musical.            
I figured she should be strong,       
since it's the 4th stage, so          
I gave this song that type of feel.   
(Which is?)

             Stage 5 theme            
I think I managed to make it feel     
very end-of-game this time.           
Yeah, it's pretty cool, isn't it?     
I really like it. (^^)

             Yumeko's theme           
This was a tough one. This has the    
most complex chord progressions I've  
ever done. This song is like a new    
start for me. I wanted to make this   
song pretty dark, so this is how it   
came out. I like this song a lot, so  
I hope you'll listen to it.

No.14 << ¢ŠE‚Ì‰Ê‚Ä  ` World's End >>
           Final Stage theme          
This song is just for a stage to      
let you get some more items before    
the boss, so it's short. Actually,    
I wanted to try to do this with       
just a heartbeat sound, but this      
isn't that kind of game. (lol)

This is the last boss theme.          
Of course, I really put a lot of      
spirit into it. I was aiming for a    
song that had the right blend of      
coolness and cuteness. The main       
melody is pretty easy to remember,    
so it has a nice feel to it.          
I'm pretty fond of it.

           Extra Stage theme          
Fairy tale-esque and cool is what     
I was going for this time.            
Well, it's probably not fairy         
tale-esque, but it's pretty cool.     
You have to dodge lots of bullets in  
the game, so you probably can't listen
to it too closely, though. (lol)

           Alice's 2nd theme          
Compared to my other extra stage boss 
themes, I paid close attention to     
the rhythm this time. No matter       
how cheap the attacks coming are,     
we can always emerge victorious

it's because I wanted to match

means there isn't much staff (so      
the staff roll is short). (lol)
