This is pretty awesomely reborn,      
I think. And yet, it really takes     
me back...

     Stages 1-4, Hell 16-19 theme     
This melody had quite an impact on me.
Even now, I'll find myself playing it 
when I compose music.

    “Œ•ûèËˆÙ“`  Rapid arrange ver.    
           Shingyoku's theme          
I get the feeling there are a few     
melodic differences from my current   
music. What could they be?            
(The chord progression hasn't changed 
much. (^^;)

No.4  <<Highly Responsive to Prayers>>
    “Œ•ûèËˆÙ“`  Slightly arranged ver.
    Makai Stages 6-9 & Credits theme  
I arranged an old musical piece, and  
now this one feels really gloomy.     
It's a calm piece, which really is    
a rarity for this game, isn't it.

    “Œ•ûèËˆÙ“` Refreshing arrange ver.
          Hell Stages 6-9 theme       
I composed this song for the first    
game I ever made, so I put quite a    
bit of thought into it.               
All the “Œ•û›››-style game titles  
also stem from this piece.

    “Œ•ûèËˆÙ“`  Strong arrange ver.   
     Yuugenmagan and Mima's theme     
This piece is the model for my current
boss themes. It doesn't seem a lot    
different now, but somehow the older  
song has WEIGHT to it. (^^;           
Or maybe it's that the current pieces 
are light? (I don't think that's it   
either...)                            
No.7       << Oriental Magician >>    
    “Œ•ûèËˆÙ“`  Groovy arrange ver.   
        Makai Stages 11-14 theme      
This might be a catchy arrangement,   
since it was originally sooo dark.    
Looks like I inadvertently made all   
the songs Japanese style... totally   
different from how I do it now. (;_;)

    “Œ•ûèËˆÙ“`  Happy arrange ver.    
          Hell Stages 11-14 theme     
This is the most bright-eyed song     
in the game, I think. So I tried      
arranging it to emphasize that feel.

    “Œ•ûèËˆÙ“`  Fantasy arrange ver.  
        Elis and Kikuri's theme       
This piece has a pretty good feel     
to it. This kind of tune (with a      
touch of mystery) is indispensable    
for mid-game. Well, not that my       
current stuff's all that different.

    “Œ•ûèËˆÙ“`  Dark arrange ver.     
        Makai Stages 16-19 theme      
This is the second song in my         
heart, composed right after           
"Strange Oriental Discourse".         
Originally, the tempo was pretty      
messed up, so I slowed it a bit.

          Sariel's 1st theme          
Nice piece for endgame, huh? Once     
you finally get here, it doesn't      
feel all that Japanese, does it.      
This may be a lot easier on the       
ears than the original piece.

    “Œ•ûèËˆÙ“`  Relaxing arrange ver. 
          Sariel's 2nd theme          
I've almost never used this piece.    
It's only used for a brief moment in  
the game. I actually composed this for
its title, so I couldn't use it after-
ward... For the arrangement, I tried  
touching it up to give the feel of its
title. This piece is my favorite.

             Konngara's theme         
This song unfolds so fast, it's like  
"Are you kidding me?".                
It puts together short phrases.       
And yet, did arranging it make it much
better?
